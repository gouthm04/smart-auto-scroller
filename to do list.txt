page endinng with scroller pause it when stops scrolling 

why the speeedd 12 and speed 13 has vast diffrence in speed 

what u think of splitting the speed logic so it handles evry kind of spped smoothlyy like slow also in smooth motion not that stuck motion 

also speed <10 like off btn we need to nadle the logic more efficenlty

if speed is less than 13 then page flickers/vibrates kinda with scrolling not that smooth 
    kinda like stuck then move stuck agin
